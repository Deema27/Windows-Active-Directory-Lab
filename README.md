# Windows-Active-Directory-Lab
This project documents my hands-on learning from the TryHackMe: Active Directory Basics room, which introduces fundamental concepts of Active Directory in a practical, lab-based environment. The room covers core topics such as domain structures, user and group management, Remote Desktop Protocol usage, PowerShell for AD administration, and Group Policy Objects. Through interactive exercises, I explored how Active Directory operates within a Windows domain, how to manage users with PowerShell, and how to apply policies using GPOs. This experience provided a foundational understanding of how enterprise networks are structured and administered, which is critical knowledge for aspiring system administrators, IT support specialists, and cybersecurity professionals.
